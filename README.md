# COMP-6001-VuProGen-Buildings-AR

## Description of the Project
This is a project for COMP-6001 Capstone Project and Dissertation at Open Institute of Technology (OPIT) for BSc in Modern Computer Science by Wong Chung Man, under the supervision of Assistant Professor Tomasz Zawadzki.

This project aims to explore the practical aspects of procedural building generation and Augmented Reality (AR). An AR mobile application is developed using Unity and Vuforia, with an UI to allow the users to procedurally generate and edit a building on an image target in real time.
