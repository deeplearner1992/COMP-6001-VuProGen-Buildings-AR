## Description of the Project
This is a project by Wong Chung Man for COMP-6001 Capstone Project and Dissertation for BSc in Modern Computer Science at Open Institute of Technology (OPIT), under the supervision of Assistant Professor Tomasz Zawadzki.

This project aims to explore the practical aspects of procedural building generation and Augmented Reality (AR). An AR mobile application is developed using Unity and Vuforia, with an UI to allow the users to procedurally generate and edit a building on an image target in real time.

## Image target file
The image target file can be found in "ImageTarget" folder.

## Issue with shadows not showing properly during initial project set-up
When the project is initally set up in Unity, the shadows do not cast properly in the editor, this is because the build profiles is set to Windows but not Android. To resolve this issue, go to File -> Build Profiles. In Build Profiles, select Android and click "Switch Platform". The shadows should then show properly.
